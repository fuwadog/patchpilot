# AI Assistant v1 - Setup Instructions

This guide will help you get the AI Assistant up and running locally.

## 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.

## 2. Installation
First, clone the repository and navigate to the project root. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Core Dependencies:
- `openai`: Main client for AI interactions.
- `prompt-toolkit`: Provides the interactive CLI with autocomplete.
- `python-dotenv`: Loads configuration from your environment file.
- `PyPDF2`, `python-docx`, `openpyxl`, `beautifulsoup4`: Libraries for reading various file formats.

## 3. Configuration (Critical)
The application requires an API key to function. This key should be stored in a `.env.local` file in the root directory.

1.  Create a file named `.env.local` in the root folder.
2.  Add your API key and configuration as follows:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_nvidia_or_openai_api_key_here
AI_MODEL=z-ai/glm4.7
AI_TEMPERATURE=0.4
MAX_FILES=12
```

> **Note:** The `.env.local` file is already listed in `.gitignore` to prevent you from accidentally sharing your secrets on GitHub.

## 4. Running the Assistant
Once the dependencies are installed and the `.env.local` file is set up, start the assistant by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 5. Usage Tips
- Type `/help` inside the app to see all available commands.
- Use `/file <path>` to load specific code files into the AI's memory.
- Use `/folder <path>` to load entire directories.
- Commands like `/fix` and `/refactor` can help you edit files directly through the AI.
